# Core Rules

## 1. Character (Kernel) Sheet

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Axiom Set (3–7) | Core interlocking principles. |
| σ_a | Computed sparsity factor. |
| χ_e | Ethical anchor coherence (0–1). |
| Baseline KII | Derived metric. |
| KPB | Paradox capacity. |
| ASP Profile | High / Medium / Low anomaly salience. |
| Resources | E_res (resilience), P_slots (paradox slots). |

## 2. Turn / Cycle Structure (Abstract)
1. Observation Phase: Gather sector data.
2. Validation Phase: Attempt consensus (adjust C_s, IOL).
3. Drift Phase: Apply drift update equation.
4. Defense Allocation: Choose actions (Throttle, Journal, Fork, Backscatter).
5. Parasite Action (GM / System): Injection attempts.
6. Resolution: Update KII, ΨΔ, CTI, logs.
7. Recovery / Training: Apply progress functions.

## 3. Action Types
- Validate Sector: Reduce IOL, raise C_s.
- Batch Interpret: Activate Predictive Throttle → lowers high-frequency ΨΔ spikes.
- Fork Sandbox: Spawn κ_fork +1 (cost: E_res).
- Paradox Integration: Reserve KPB slot to damp future yield.
- Backscatter Prime: Arm lens; next injection with Δκ above threshold rebounds.

## 4. Conflict Resolution
Roll Format (if gamified):
- Base Difficulty derived from parasite strategy (e.g. Target Drift Grade).
- Player Defense Modifier = f(KII, C_s, chosen actions).
- Success reduces ΔΨ_Δ for that cycle.

## 5. Stress & Collapse
- CTI Spike: If CTI growth rate > threshold twice in succession, forced test vs. KII.
- Collapse Track: 5 segments (Stable → Strained → Fractured → Critical → Collapse).
- Crossing segment triggers penalty (e.g. -0.1 χ_e until stabilized).

## 6. Recovery
- Guided Paradox Integration Session: +F_p, minor E_res cost.
- Resonance Ritual (group): Adjust H, boosts C_s next cycle.
- Journaling Burst: +J_d, reduces D(t) slope.

## 7. Advancement
- Milestones grant right to propose Axiom Addition.
- Run Axiom Safety Criterion; on success, recalc KII.
- Over-axiomatization penalty if n_axioms > 7 (σ_a drop).

## 8. Failure Modes
- Gradient Collapse Event: E_ext ≥ Λ_OCT OR KII_eff ≤ 0.15.
- Rigidity Lock: H sustained high + novelty < threshold for 5 cycles → vulnerability to macro drift.

## 9. GM / System Guidance
Tune parasite pressure using:
- Injection Complexity (Δκ)
- Latency Manipulation
- Drift Seeding (χ)
Set baseline λ₀ for encounter intensity.

## 10. Quick Reference
- Defensive Loop: Observe → Validate → Diffuse Errors → Log → Paradox Hold → Adapt.
- Offense (Parasite) Loop: Probe Latency → Inject Drift → Amplify Dissonance → Harvest → Avoid OCT.
