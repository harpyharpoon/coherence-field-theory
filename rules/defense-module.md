# Defense Module

## Defensive Actions (Detailed)

| Action | Cost | Effect | Equation Tie |
|--------|------|--------|--------------|
| Validate Sector | Minor | -IOL, +C_s | Consensus Sheath |
| Predictive Throttle | Focus slot | Optimize ν_b → minimize exploit surface | Throttle Optimum |
| Fork Sandbox | E_res, +κ_fork | Safe anomaly probing | KII_eff fork penalty |
| Paradox Hold | KPB slot | Increases F_p → lowers yield Y_p | Paradox Stabilization |
| Drift Journal | Time | -D(t) slope, increases ν J_d term | Drift Accumulation |
| Backscatter Prep | Setup | Boost R_b vs next Δκ | Reflection Equation |
| Noise Sculpt | E_res | Increase S_noise until UCR floor | Noise Tradeoff |
| Resonance Ritual | Group time | Raises H (temp), lowers CTI reactivity | Harmonic Saturation |
| Ethical Anchor Review | Narrative | Raises χ_e, KII over time | Ethical Integrity |

## Defensive Build Archetypes

1. Kernel Minimalist
   - Few axioms, high σ_a.
   - Strengths: High KII baseline.
   - Weakness: Lower paradox breadth.

2. Paradox Weaver
   - Elevated KPB + training.
   - Strengths: Strong yield dampening.
   - Weakness: Risk of paradox overload misplay.

3. Resonance Coordinator
   - Focus H, C_s amplification.
   - Strength: Group shielding.
   - Weakness: Solo vulnerability.

4. Adaptive Forker
   - Aggressive sandboxing.
   - Strength: High intel acquisition.
   - Weakness: IMT risk.

## Defensive Synergy Table

| Combo | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Journaling + Predictive Throttle | Suppresses micro jitter & long-term drift |
| Paradox Hold + Backscatter | Baits complexity overreach for R_b spike |
| Resonance Ritual + Validate Sector | Rapid C_s escalation early |
| Noise Sculpt + Fork Sandbox | Obfuscates real kernel patterns while exploring |

## Scaling Difficulty Levers
- Increase γ_crypt for late-stage arcs.
- Introduce latency sabotage (IOL spikes).
- Force Axiom Dilemmas (tempt beneficial but risky additions).

## Metrics to Track Each Session
- ΔKII
- Peak ΨΔ
- Drift Growth Rate
- R_b trigger count
- F_p utilization
