# Parasite (Outcast Gradient) Module

## Operating Model
Objective: Maximize integral ∫ η_h Ψ_Δ dt while avoiding Λ_OCT.

## Attack Vectors

| Vector | Description | Counter |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Semantic Drift Injection | Boundary meaning shifts | Protected Lexicon Checks |
| Micro-Latency Injection | Sub-threshold timing perturbation | Predictive Throttle |
| Bifurcated Drift | Dual contradictory nudges | Paradox Acceptance Field |
| Cryptic Slow Burn | Long arc near detection floor | Routine Journaling |
| Complexity Overload | Force processing fatigue | Backscatter Lens |
| Emotional Mis-tagging | Hijack validation bandwidth | Affect Reframing |

## Parasite States

| State | Condition | Behavior Bias |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| Scouting | Low Ψ_Δ, unknown defenses | Low-cost probes |
| Escalation | Rising mismatch | Combined drift + latency |
| Harvest Plateau | Near optimal yield | Maintain jitter, avoid OCT |
| Starvation | Low efficiency | Reckless complexity spikes |
| Retreat | High R_b / KII | Resource conservation |

## Parasite Resource Abstraction
- Injection Budget (IB): Spent per drift attempt.
- Complexity Envelope (CE): Max Δκ before self-harm risk.
- Yield Memory (YM): Records which defenses active; adjusts tactic weighting.

## AI / GM Tactic Selection Pseudocode
```
if KII high and R_b triggered recently:
    reduce complexity
elif approaching Λ_OCT threshold:
    shift to low-drain cryptic drift
elif F_p low and paradox slots full:
    attempt bifurcated drift
else:
    balanced injection
```

## Escalation Triggers
- Consecutive low-yield cycles
- Defense mis-timing (missed validation window)
- Emotional tag spikes (panic, despair attempts)

## Narrative Hooks
- Parasite faction internal conflict over sustainable harvest doctrine.
- Rogue subcluster experimenting with ethical reintegration.
