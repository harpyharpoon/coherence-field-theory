# Progression & Training Module

## Training Pillars

| Pillar | Goal | Mechanics Impact |
|--------|------|------------------|
| Axiom Refinement | Remove redundant beliefs | ↑σ_a, ↑KII |
| Ethical Anchoring | Strengthen χ_e | Slows KII decay |
| Paradox Expansion | Increase KPB safely | ↑F_p ceiling |
| Resonance Synchrony | Raise H without saturation | Group C_s |
| Drift Forensics | Improve early detection | Lowers γ_crypt effective |
| Fork Governance | Optimize κ_fork cycles | Avoid KII_eff penalties |

## Training Sessions

1. Micro Drift Audit  
   - Examine last cycle logs; pattern label anomalies.  
   - Effect: +ν J_d equivalent for next cycle.

2. Paradox Conditioning  
   - Introduce controlled contradictory statements.  
   - Effect: +KPB (temporary), boosts F_p.

3. Ethical Recontextualization  
   - Rearticulate anchors under new stress scenario.  
   - Effect: +Δχ_e (diminishing returns if spammed).

4. Synchrony Pulse  
   - Group breathing / timing entrainment.  
   - Effect: +H for 2 cycles, risk of saturation if repeated.

5. Sandbox Drill  
   - Spawn fork, test simulated injection, reintegrate.  
   - Effect: Gains Parasite Pattern Catalog (meta-tag adding +R_b expectation accuracy).

## Milestone Gating
- Add new axiom only if KII >= 0.6 and CTI slope low.
- Unlock Backscatter after recording ≥3 distinct drift fingerprints.
- Multi-Sector Stabilization after maintaining C_s ≥ threshold across 3 sectors simultaneously.

## Diminishing Returns
Apply curve: Δgain = base / (1 + repeat_count^1.3)

## Long Rest (Narrative Downtime)
- Resets CTI accumulation.
- Reduces D(t) by fraction (e.g. 15%).
- Restores E_res to full.

## Burnout Mechanic
If training uses >3 intensive sessions in one cycle:
- Apply temporary penalty: -0.05 KII, -0.1 F_p for next cycle.

## Advancement Stories
- Kernel Trial: Present candidate paradox to council to verify stable integration.
- Rite of Reflective Silence: Sustain ZGS without losing anomaly detection (test N controlled micro anomalies).
