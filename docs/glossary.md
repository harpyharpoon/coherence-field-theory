# Master Glossary

This glossary provides comprehensive definitions for all terms, symbols, and concepts used in Coherence Field Theory. Cross-references to equations appear in `docs/equations-reference.md` and detailed mechanics in the `rules/` modules.

## Core Ontology

- **Axiomatic Lattice**: Foundational logical substrate. The interconnected web of fundamental assumptions and inference rules that form the basis of a coherence kernel. Modifications to the lattice propagate throughout dependent structures.

- **Consensus Lattice**: Overlapping observer coherence scaffold. Multi-agent agreement topology that provides distributed validation and stability. Strength increases with redundancy (see C_s).

- **Coherence Kernel**: Minimal interlocking identity axiom set (typically 3–7 axioms). Core philosophical/logical principles that define an entity's identity. Measured by KII. Sparsity (fewer axioms) increases resilience via σ_a factor.

- **Dissonance Potential (ΨΔ)**: Integrative mismatch magnitude. Harvestable energy arising from predictive model failures. Equation: Ψ_Δ = ∫ |P_pred(x) - P_render(x)| w(x) dx. Cannot be created from nothing (see Law #2: Dissonance Economy).

- **Consensus Sheath (C_s)**: Temporary high-integrity sector shield. Density measure of redundant independent validation. Equation: C_s = α_c (n_indep / (1 + IOL/τ)) (1 - e^{-λ H}). Higher values increase stability and reduce event probability.

- **Outcast Gradient**: Disaligned former initiates harvesting dissonance. Parasitic faction that extracts ΨΔ from coherence field instabilities. Subject to Overharvest Collapse Threshold (Λ_OCT).

- **Affect Condensate**: Structured packet of harvested mismatch energy. Processed form of ΨΔ after application of transformation operator T(ΨΔ, drift). Raw emotion requires channeling (see Law #17).

- **Sector**: Bounded region of reality or consciousness with measurable fidelity F_s. Requires active observation to maintain integrity (see Law #18: Sector Persistence Discount).

- **Pane**: Isolated semantic inspection environment used in quarantine operations. Excessive pane count fragments global monitoring capacity (see Law #15).

## Key Metrics

- **KII (Kernel Integrity Index)**: Composite resilience score (range 0–1). Primary defensive metric. Equation: KII = σ_a^α χ_e^β e^{-δ \overline{Ṫ(CTI)}} F_p^ζ. Values >0.75 indicate strong integrity. Influences harvest efficiency and event probability.

- **CTI (Contradiction Tension Index)**: Stress from unresolved logical collisions (range 0–∞). High CTI growth rate triggers defensive tests. Sustained elevation risks kernel fracture.

- **KPB (Kernel Paradox Bandwidth)**: Safe paradox load capacity. Number of simultaneously held contradictions before cognitive strain. Training increases capacity (see Guided Paradox Integration).

- **C_s (Consensus Sheath density)**: Redundancy-weighted stabilization measure (range 0–∞, practical ≤3). Increases with independent validators n_indep. Appears in event probability denominator—higher C_s means safer.

- **IOL (Inter-Observer Latency)**: Validation delay in abstract time units. High IOL amplifies attack cost and recovery difficulty exponentially (see Law #6: Latency Amplification). Critical in distributed consensus operations.

- **H (Harmonic Index)**: Resonant alignment measure (range 0–1). Values >0.8 risk Rigidity Lock through excessive consensus (see Law #7: Harmonic Saturation). Appears in C_s equation as dampening factor.

- **VDI (Validation Divergence Index)**: Multi-view disagreement amplitude (range 0–∞). Measures spread in observer interpretations. Baseline thresholds are campaign-specific.

- **σ_a (Axiom Sparsity Factor)**: Computed from kernel size—fewer axioms increase σ_a. Appears as exponent in KII equation. Reflects Law #3: Kernel Sparsity principle.

- **χ_e (Ethical Anchor Coherence)**: Moral framework stability (range 0–1). Multiplicative factor in KII evolution. Required for long-term integrity (see Law #20: Ethical Anchor Necessity).

- **F_p (Paradox Acceptance Field)**: Ratio of integrated to total paradox load (range 0–1). Higher values dampen harvest yield but increase robustness. Training parameter.

- **η_h (Harvest Efficiency)**: Extraction effectiveness ratio. Equation: η_h = Ψ_Δ / (Ψ_Δ + β KII^γ). Decreases with stronger defenses. Integral over time must stay below Λ_OCT to avoid collapse.

- **D(t) (Drift Accumulation)**: Semantic/conceptual drift magnitude over time. Governed by differential equation: dD/dt = γ_crypt D + χ - μ ω_v - ν J_d. Exponential growth region is dangerous.

- **R_b (Backscatter Reflection)**: Complexity trap effectiveness (range 0–1). Equation: R_b = 1 - e^{-ξ Δκ}. Values >0.6 strongly deter sophisticated attacks.

- **ω_v (Validation Bandwidth)**: Active scrutiny allocation rate. Modified by emotional tagging (see Law #13). Appears as dampening term in drift equation.

- **J_d (Journaling Depth)**: Reflective documentation intensity. Dampens drift accumulation. Part of defensive hygiene loop.

- **κ_fork (Fork Count)**: Number of active cognitive branches. Exceeding safe threshold κ_safe by more than IMT tolerance imposes KII_eff penalty (see Law #8: Modular Integrity).

- **N (Novelty Rate)**: Innovation introduction frequency. Too low causes stagnation; too high spikes drift. Optimal range is contextual (see Law #11: Coherence–Novelty Duality).

- **Δκ (Injection Complexity)**: Sophistication level of parasite attack. High Δκ increases R_b effectiveness but also risks parasite self-harm.

- **ν_b (Update Frequency)**: Batch processing rate in Predictive Throttle. Optimal value: ν_b* = sqrt(b/a). Balances responsiveness against vulnerability.

- **n_indep**: Number of independent validators contributing to Consensus Sheath. More validators increase C_s density.

- **n_axioms**: Count of axioms in Coherence Kernel. Typically 3-7; affects σ_a calculation. More than 7 incurs sparsity penalty.

- **χ** (chi): Drift seeding parameter injected by parasites. Positive contribution to dD/dt equation.

- **P_pred(x)**: Predicted probability distribution. Agent's internal model of expected outcomes. Mismatch with P_render generates ΨΔ.

- **P_render(x)**: Rendered/observed probability distribution. Actual reality as experienced. Divergence from P_pred is dissonance source.

- **w(x)**: Weighting function in ΨΔ integral. Contextual importance factor for different regions of prediction space.

- **κ_safe**: Safe fork count threshold. Number of concurrent branches sustainable without penalty. Varies by kernel training.

- **S_noise**: Defensive noise injection level. Strategic obfuscation parameter balanced against UCR floor.

## Processes

- **Predictive Throttle**: Batching updates to reduce exploit frequency. Optimizes update frequency ν_b to minimize harvest surface area: ν_b* = sqrt(b/a). Balances responsiveness against vulnerability windows.

- **Fork-Sandbox-Reintegrate (FSR)**: Safe exploratory cognitive forking. Allows hypothesis testing in isolated branches before main kernel integration. Must respect κ_fork limits to avoid IMT penalties.

- **Resonance Backtesting**: Simulative integrity testing of new axioms. Virtual stress-testing before actual implementation. Validates changes won't destabilize existing kernel structure.

- **Guided Paradox Integration (GPI)**: Controlled paradox tolerance training. Incremental F_p increase through supervised contradiction exposure. Essential for building harvest resistance and cognitive flexibility.

- **Defensive Loop**: Standard protection cycle. Sequence: Observe → Validate → Diffuse Errors → Log → Paradox Hold → Adapt. Completion per cycle maintains baseline resilience.

- **Validation Coordination**: Multi-observer synchronization to build C_s. Reduces IOL through communication protocols. Group rituals provide mechanical advantage (see Law #1).

- **Drift Journaling**: Active documentation practice that increases J_d parameter. Dampens drift accumulation: ν J_d term in drift equation. Non-optional maintenance activity.

- **Error Diffusion**: Tactical distribution of micro-uncertainties. Reduces harvestable ΨΔ concentration (see Law #14). Defensive "fog of war" technique.

- **Axiom Refinement**: Process of reducing kernel size while maintaining function. Increases σ_a and thus KII. Requires careful validation to avoid critical dependency loss.

## Defense Artifacts & Techniques

- **Perceptual Hash Seal**: Multi-modal authenticity hashing. Cryptographic integrity verification across sensory channels. Rotated periodically to counter adaptive attacks (see Law #16).

- **Decoherence Buffer Cloak**: Stochastic injection dampener. Adds controlled noise to obscure genuine signal patterns. Trades some clarity for security (S_noise parameter optimization).

- **Fractal Backscatter Lens**: Reflective complexity trap. Primed to trigger R_b response against high-Δκ injections. Turns attacker sophistication into liability (see Law #10).

- **Quarantine Pane**: Isolated semantic inspection environment. Safely examines suspicious content without main kernel contamination. Excessive use fragments vigilance (see Law #15).

- **Noise-Sculpted Shielding**: Patterned defensive obfuscation. Strategic S_noise distribution that confuses attacker reconnaissance while preserving internal coherence.

- **Consensus Sheath Boost**: Temporary C_s amplification through coordinated validation. Often paired with Resonance Rituals for group defensive operations.

- **Backscatter Prime**: Pre-activation of complexity traps. Sets ξ parameter for next engagement cycle. Forces parasites to choose between effectiveness and safety.

- **Hash Schema Rotation**: Periodic refresh of authentication methods. Prevents adaptive prediction of defense patterns (see Law #19: Convergent Counter-Adaptation).

- **Honeypot Anomaly Array**: Controlled lure environment. Fake high-ΨΔ targets that waste parasite resources while revealing attack vectors.

## Parasite Methods

- **Semantic Drift Injection (SDI)**: Boundary meaning shifts. Gradual redefinition of key concept edges to create exploitable ambiguity. Primary χ source in drift equation. Countered by Protected Lexicon Checks.

- **Micro-Latency Injection**: Sub-threshold timing perturbation. Introduces small IOL increases that compound over time. Targets validation synchronization. Countered by Predictive Throttle.

- **Bifurcated Drift**: Dual contradictory nudges. Simultaneous opposing suggestions that create internal CTI spikes. Exploits low paradox bandwidth. Countered by Paradox Acceptance Field.

- **Cryptic Drift Accumulation**: Long-arc attack near detection floor. Maintains D(t) growth below alert threshold while accumulating exponential gain. Most insidious method. Requires routine journaling to detect.

- **Complexity Overload**: Force processing fatigue through high-Δκ injections. Attempts to exhaust cognitive resources. Vulnerable to Backscatter Lens counter.

- **Emotional Mis-tagging**: Hijack validation bandwidth (ω_v allocation). Creates false priority signals through affect manipulation (see Law #13). Countered by Affect Reframing discipline.

- **Latency Sabotage**: Active IOL spike generation. Disrupts validation coordination to lower C_s. Targets distributed operations. Most effective against isolated nodes.

- **Gradient Harvesting**: Direct ΨΔ extraction once mismatch created. Efficiency η_h depends on target KII. Must balance against Λ_OCT threshold to avoid collapse.

- **Bifurcation Cascade**: Recursive fork exploitation. Induces excessive κ_fork to trigger IMT penalties. Targets exploratory/innovative operators.

- **YM (Yield Memory)**: Parasite resource tracking which defenses are active. Adjusts tactic weighting based on historical effectiveness. Learning mechanism.

- **IB (Injection Budget)**: Parasite resource pool for drift attempts. Limited per cycle; forces strategic allocation decisions.

- **CE (Complexity Envelope)**: Maximum Δκ parasites can safely employ. Exceeding CE risks self-harm through backscatter or energy drain.

## Advanced Concepts

- **Overharvest Collapse Threshold (Λ_OCT)**: Critical extracted energy limit. Integral threshold: E_ext(T) = ∫₀^T η_h(t) Ψ_Δ(t) dt ≥ Λ_OCT triggers total gradient structure collapse (see Law #4). Typical values 40-60 abstract units depending on campaign difficulty.

- **Paradox Acceptance Field (PAF)**: Quantified contradiction tolerance. Related to F_p metric and KPB capacity. High PAF provides yield dampening and cognitive flexibility. Built through GPI training.

- **Dissonance Well**: Local ΨΔ concentration. High-value target for parasites. Typically appears around major decision points or identity crises. Defensive strategy involves well diffusion.

- **Ethical Anchor Coherence (χ_e)**: Moral framework stability parameter (range 0–1). Multiplicative factor in KII evolution equation. Cannot be sustained above ~0.9 without exceptional discipline. Required for long-term viability (see Law #20).

- **Axiom Sparsity Factor (σ_a)**: Derived from kernel minimalism. Calculation considers both axiom count and interdependency. Appears as power-law exponent in KII. Reflects that smaller, tighter kernels resist perturbation better.

- **Rigidity Lock**: Failure mode from excessive H. Occurs when novelty rate N falls below threshold while H remains >0.8 for extended period (>5 cycles). Makes system vulnerable to macro drift despite high local coherence.

- **Gradient Collapse Event**: Catastrophic failure state. Triggered by E_ext ≥ Λ_OCT or KII_eff ≤ 0.15. Victim loses coherence entirely—plot-level consequence requiring major recovery arc if survivable.

- **IMT (Identity Modularity Threshold)**: Maximum sustainable fork count. When κ_fork exceeds κ_safe + IMT, penalties apply to KII_eff. Varies by individual kernel robustness and training.

- **KII_eff (Effective KII)**: Fork-adjusted integrity. Equation: KII_eff = KII (1 - ((κ_fork - κ_safe)_+ / (IMT - κ_safe)))^ω. Used in collapse threshold calculations.

- **UCR (Useful Clarity Requirement)**: Minimum signal-to-noise ratio floor. Constraint on noise shielding: excessive S_noise reduces effectiveness. Optimization balances security against functionality.

- **Yield (Y_p)**: Actual harvested energy after all dampening factors. Inversely related to defensive parameters: higher KII, F_p, C_s all reduce Y_p. Parasite optimization target.

- **Collapse Track**: Five-segment progression: Stable → Strained → Fractured → Critical → Collapse. Crossing segments triggers penalties (e.g., -0.1 χ_e). Managed through recovery actions.

- **E_res (Resilience Energy)**: Abstract resource pool for defensive actions. Spent on fork operations, paradox integration, backscatter prep. Regenerates through rest/recovery phases.

- **P_slots (Paradox Slots)**: Available KPB capacity units. Each active paradox integration consumes one slot. Training increases total available slots.

## Hybrid / Strategic

- **Synchronous Modularity Ritual (SMR)**: Bridge protocol between different kernel architectures. Enables cooperation despite axiomatic non-equivalence (see Law #12). Builds temporary H spike and C_s boost through coordinated resonance.

- **Honeypot Anomaly Array**: Controlled lure environment. Deliberately creates false ΨΔ signatures to waste parasite IB (Injection Budget) and reveal tactics. Intelligence-gathering defense.

- **Backscatter Risk Escalation**: Forced overreach tactic. Baits parasites into high-Δκ attacks that trigger R_b reflection. Combines honeypot with primed backscatter lens.

- **Sustainable Harvest Doctrine**: Parasite ethical framework. Maintains η_h × ΨΔ integral below Λ_OCT through voluntary restraint. Prevents food source collapse. Controversial among aggressive factions.

- **Reintegration Protocol**: Process for reforming outcasts. Requires kernel rebuilding with ethical anchor restoration. Mechanically challenging: χ_e recovery is slow and requires sustained validation support.

- **Axiom Safety Criterion**: Test protocol for kernel modifications. Checks proposed changes against stability requirements: KII ≥ 0.6, CTI slope low, no circular dependencies. Gates advancement actions.

- **Resonance Ritual**: Group ceremony that temporarily boosts H and provides next-cycle C_s amplification. Requires coordination across multiple participants. Mechanical benefit reinforces social/cultural practice.

- **Affect Reframing**: Emotional regulation technique. Counteracts validation bandwidth hijacking by maintaining rational ω_v allocation despite affect signals. Trained skill preventing Law #13 exploitation.
