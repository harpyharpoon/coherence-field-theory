(Condensed from prior response; reorganized alphabetically. For full detail including tags see earlier world bible.)

## Core Ontology
- Axiomatic Lattice: Foundational logical substrate.
- Consensus Lattice: Overlapping observer coherence scaffold.
- Coherence Kernel: Minimal interlocking identity axiom set.
- Dissonance Potential (ΨΔ): Integrative mismatch magnitude.
- Consensus Sheath: Temporary high-integrity sector shield.
- Outcast Gradient: Disaligned former initiates harvesting dissonance.
- Affect Condensate: Structured packet of harvested mismatch energy.

## Key Metrics
- KII (Kernel Integrity Index): Composite resilience.
- CTI (Contradiction Tension Index): Stress from unresolved collisions.
- KPB (Kernel Paradox Bandwidth): Safe paradox load capacity.
- C_s (Consensus Sheath density): Redundancy-weighted stabilization.
- IOL (Inter-Observer Latency): Validation delay.
- H (Harmonic Index): Resonant alignment measure.
- VDI (Validation Divergence Index): Multi-view disagreement amplitude.

## Processes
- Predictive Throttle: Batching updates to reduce exploit frequency.
