# Design Philosophy

Goals:
- Abstract complexity into modular metrics.
- Model tension between stability and innovation.
- Provide levers for narrative stakes (resources, thresholds).

Balance Principles:
1. No invulnerable state: High KII narrows but never removes exploit surface.
2. Tradeoff Matrix: Strengthening one axis (e.g. fork exploration) reduces another (baseline cohesion).
3. Bounded Math: All scales 0–1 or normalized forms to simplify simulation.

Extensibility:
- Add new resource types by defining harvest & stabilization transforms.
- Introduce faction-specific exponents (α, β, δ) to differentiate style.
