# Universal Laws (In-Universe Canon)

Each Law = Statement → Mechanics → Narrative Hooks.

1. Consensus Conservation  
   - Stability requires redundant independent validation.  
   - Mechanics: C_s increases with n_indep; drift harder.

2. Dissonance Economy  
   - ΨΔ arises only from predictive mismatch; cannot be conjured free.  
   - Mechanics: Harvest depends on existing Δ distributions.

3. Kernel Sparsity  
   - Fewer, interdependent axioms heighten resilience.  
   - Mechanics: σ_a factor in KII.

4. Overharvest Collapse (OCT)  
   - Exceeding Λ_OCT destroys gradient structure.  
   - Mechanics: Integral of η_h ΨΔ triggers collapse.

5. Paradox Stabilization  
   - Controlled paradox load increases robustness.  
   - Mechanics: F_p modulates KII, dampens yield.

6. Latency Amplification  
   - High IOL inflates recovery cost; early validation critical.  
   - Mechanics: Attack cost scaling C_attack ~ (IOL)^p.

7. Harmonic Saturation  
   - Excess resonance risks Rigidity Lock.  
   - Mechanics: Diminishing returns beyond H plateau.

8. Modular Integrity  
   - Forking past IMT erodes cohesion.  
   - Mechanics: KII_eff penalty for κ_fork overflow.

9. Drift Accumulation  
   - Sub-threshold drift compounds exponentially.  
   - Mechanics: dD/dt = γ D + ...

10. Reflective Backscatter  
    - Overcomplex injection rebounds entropy.  
    - Mechanics: R_b = 1 - exp(-ξ Δκ).

11. Coherence–Novelty Duality  
    - Adaptive evolution requires balanced novelty rate N.  
    - Mechanics: Too low N → stagnation; too high → drift spikes.

12. Axiomatic Non-Equivalence  
    - Different kernels can converge functionally.  
    - Mechanics: Alignment measured by emergent envelope correlation, not axiom identity.

13. Validation Bandwidth Prioritization  
    - Emotional tagging redirects validation resources.  
    - Mechanics: Affect modifies ω_v allocation.

14. Error Distribution  
    - Diffused micro-errors less harvestable than macro lumps.  
    - Mechanics: Defensive diffusion reduces η_h advantage.

15. Quarantined Containment  
    - Overuse of isolation fragments vigilance.  
    - Mechanics: Pane count reduces global monitoring capacity.

16. Recursive Integrity Checks  
    - Static defenses degrade; rotation mandatory.  
    - Mechanics: Hash schema aging variable.

17. Emotional Gradient Non-Transmutability  
    - Raw emotion inert; needs structured drift channel.  
    - Mechanics: No transform without operator T(ΨΔ, drift).

18. Sector Persistence Discount  
    - Unobserved fidelity decays.  
    - Mechanics: F_s(t) = F_s0 e^{-ρ (1 - C_s)t}.

19. Convergent Counter-Adaptation  
    - Predictability of defense reopens vulnerability.  
    - Mechanics: Adaptive variance parameter.

20. Ethical Anchor Necessity  
    - Long-term KII requires moral framework.  
    - Mechanics: χ_e appears multiplicatively in KII evolution.
