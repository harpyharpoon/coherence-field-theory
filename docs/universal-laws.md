# Universal Laws (In-Universe Canon)

Each Law = Statement → Mechanics → Narrative Hooks.

1. Consensus Conservation  
   - Stability requires redundant independent validation.  
   - Mechanics: C_s increases with n_indep; drift harder.
   - Narrative Hooks: Group coordination rituals provide mechanical advantage. Solo operators vulnerable to isolation attacks. Trust-building between factions has measurable defensive value.

2. Dissonance Economy  
   - ΨΔ arises only from predictive mismatch; cannot be conjured free.  
   - Mechanics: Harvest depends on existing Δ distributions.
   - Narrative Hooks: Parasites must find or create genuine uncertainty. Fabricated conflicts yield nothing. Initiates in crisis generate resource spikes worth exploiting.

3. Kernel Sparsity  
   - Fewer, interdependent axioms heighten resilience.  
   - Mechanics: σ_a factor in KII.
   - Narrative Hooks: Philosophical minimalism is practical defense. Characters who cling to contradictory principles suffer mechanically. Kernel refinement as spiritual discipline.

4. Overharvest Collapse (OCT)  
   - Exceeding Λ_OCT destroys gradient structure.  
   - Mechanics: Integral of η_h ΨΔ triggers collapse.
   - Narrative Hooks: Greedy parasites destroy their own food source. Wise factions practice sustainable harvest. OCT events are catastrophic plot drivers—victims lose coherence entirely.

5. Paradox Stabilization  
   - Controlled paradox load increases robustness.  
   - Mechanics: F_p modulates KII, dampens yield.
   - Narrative Hooks: Embracing contradictions trains mental flexibility. Paradox integration sessions are ritualized training. Too much breaks minds; too little leaves them brittle.

6. Latency Amplification  
   - High IOL inflates recovery cost; early validation critical.  
   - Mechanics: Attack cost scaling C_attack ~ (IOL)^p.
   - Narrative Hooks: Delayed communication enables deep infiltration. Isolated outposts face exponential danger. Real-time consensus networks provide strategic dominance.

7. Harmonic Saturation  
   - Excess resonance risks Rigidity Lock.  
   - Mechanics: Diminishing returns beyond H plateau.
   - Narrative Hooks: Perfect agreement stifles adaptation. Echo chambers become vulnerable to novel attacks. Healthy communities balance harmony with constructive dissent.

8. Modular Integrity  
   - Forking past IMT erodes cohesion.  
   - Mechanics: KII_eff penalty for κ_fork overflow.
   - Narrative Hooks: Cognitive forking enables safe exploration but risks identity fragmentation. Characters juggling too many alternate selves lose grounding. Fork management is practical necessity.

9. Drift Accumulation  
   - Sub-threshold drift compounds exponentially.  
   - Mechanics: dD/dt = γ_crypt D + χ - μ ω_v - ν J_d
   - Narrative Hooks: Small unnoticed changes compound into existential crisis. Journaling and validation are hygiene, not optional. Neglect today breeds catastrophe tomorrow.

10. Reflective Backscatter  
    - Overcomplex injection rebounds entropy.  
    - Mechanics: R_b = 1 - exp(-ξ Δκ).
    - Narrative Hooks: Sophisticated attacks can backfire spectacularly. Defenders prime "complexity traps" to punish overreach. Parasites learn caution through painful lessons.

11. Coherence–Novelty Duality  
    - Adaptive evolution requires balanced novelty rate N.  
    - Mechanics: Too low N → stagnation; too high → drift spikes.
    - Narrative Hooks: Innovation essential but risky. Traditionalists and progressives both have valid concerns. Optimal cultural evolution walks a knife's edge between extremes.

12. Axiomatic Non-Equivalence  
    - Different kernels can converge functionally.  
    - Mechanics: Alignment measured by emergent envelope correlation, not axiom identity.
    - Narrative Hooks: Diverse belief systems can cooperate effectively. Theological disputes don't preclude alliance. Outcomes matter more than ontology for practical coordination.

13. Validation Bandwidth Prioritization  
    - Emotional tagging redirects validation resources.  
    - Mechanics: Affect modifies ω_v allocation.
    - Narrative Hooks: Fear and desire shape what gets scrutinized. Emotional manipulation is tactical vector. Characters must balance feeling with critical assessment.

14. Error Distribution  
    - Diffused micro-errors less harvestable than macro lumps.  
    - Mechanics: Defensive diffusion reduces η_h advantage.
    - Narrative Hooks: Spreading uncertainty dilutes attack value. "Fog of war" tactics protect against exploitation. Concentrated crises are more dangerous than ambient confusion.

15. Quarantined Containment  
    - Overuse of isolation fragments vigilance.  
    - Mechanics: Pane count reduces global monitoring capacity.
    - Narrative Hooks: Compartmentalization has costs. Too many secrets create blind spots. Security theater weakens real security through resource dilution.

16. Recursive Integrity Checks  
    - Static defenses degrade; rotation mandatory.  
    - Mechanics: Hash schema aging variable.
    - Narrative Hooks: Security requires constant renewal. Yesterday's protections become tomorrow's vulnerabilities. Adaptation is perpetual arms race, not one-time solution.

17. Emotional Gradient Non-Transmutability  
    - Raw emotion inert; needs structured drift channel.  
    - Mechanics: No transform without operator T(ΨΔ, drift).
    - Narrative Hooks: Feelings alone don't create exploitable energy. Parasites need technical infrastructure to harvest affect. Emotional literacy is defensive skill—understanding prevents weaponization.

18. Sector Persistence Discount  
    - Unobserved fidelity decays.  
    - Mechanics: F_s(t) = F_s0 e^{-ρ (1 - C_s)t}.
    - Narrative Hooks: Neglected relationships and responsibilities deteriorate. Presence matters. Automated systems need active maintenance or degrade through entropy.

19. Convergent Counter-Adaptation  
    - Predictability of defense reopens vulnerability.  
    - Mechanics: Adaptive variance parameter.
    - Narrative Hooks: Routine invites exploitation. Unpredictability is defensive asset. Both sides evolve tactics continuously—strategic landscape never stabilizes.

20. Ethical Anchor Necessity  
    - Long-term KII requires moral framework.  
    - Mechanics: χ_e appears multiplicatively in KII evolution.
    - Narrative Hooks: Pragmatism without principle invites corruption. Moral foundation provides structural stability. Characters who abandon ethics suffer mechanical decay regardless of tactical skill.
