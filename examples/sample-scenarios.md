# Sample Scenarios

## Scenario 1: Fractured Relay Node
- Problem: Validation relay latency spike (IOL 3× normal).
- Objective: Restore C_s > 1.0 within 4 cycles.
- Complication: Cryptic drift seeds (γ_crypt temporarily +0.04).
- Suggested Tools: Batch validation teams + Backscatter lure.

## Scenario 2: Overharvest Gambit
- Parasite near Λ_OCT threshold but unaware.
- Player Goal: Feign low KII to encourage unsustainable escalation, trigger collapse.
- Mechanics: Controlled paradox holds to absorb yield attempts.

## Scenario 3: Kernel Trial
- Add new axiom “Agency persists amid uncertainty.”
- Run safety criterion; success raises χ_e synergy if CTI slope stable.

## Scenario 4: Fading Archive Sector
- F_s down to 0.35; recover to ≥0.7.
- Requires patrol rotation (C_s boosting) + novelty infusion to avoid Rigidity Lock.

## Scenario 5: Fork Spillover
- Adaptive Forker exceeded IMT; KII_eff crash.
- Mission: Reintegrate or retire forks while defending against opportunistic drift surge.

## Scenario 6: Emotional Tag Hijack
- Parasites injecting false urgency around low-risk anomaly.
- Counter: Affect reclassification + reallocation of validation bandwidth.

## Scenario 7: Backscatter Tournament
- Competitive event: lure highest Δκ overshoot without self-collapse.
- Score by reflected entropy and minimal CTI spikes.
