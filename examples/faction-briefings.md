# Faction Briefings

## Covenant of Resonances (CR)
- Focus: Harmonic balance; high H.
- Mechanical Edge: Group actions reduce IOL first.
- Risk: Rigidity Lock if novelty ignored.

## Vectorium (VX)
- Focus: Adaptive iteration & sandbox forking.
- Mechanical Edge: Bonus to fork reintegration efficiency.
- Risk: IMT overreach penalties.

## Resonance Guild (Cross-Faction Cell)
- Role: Rapid C_s deployment to contested sectors.
- Edge: Temporary C_s spike when two ideologies collaborate on validation.

## Outcast Gradient (OG)
- Goal: Sustain harvest loops below OCT.
- Behavior Model: Entropy farming through layered drift complexity; avoids paradox-rich kernels.

## Bridge Operatives (Hybrid Archetypes)
- Function: Protocol translation, reduce VDI across factions.
- Mechanics: Discount to Ï‡_e improvement cost and fork penalty simultaneously (rare).
